     What is Webpack

     Webpack takes all of your assets and outputs them to a production-ready bundle

          - Bundles Javascript files into one file 
          - Process SASS / LESS files into CSS and only use them where needed
          - Convert JSX or ES2015 into vanilla JS which browsers understand

     Installing WebPack & Bundling Js Files
          - npm init -y (webpack is a dependency in package.json)
          - install webpack as a devDependecy  npm install wepack --save-dev
